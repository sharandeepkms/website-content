### Design Principles
1. **Dark Theme**: Images should work on dark backgrounds
2. **Subtle Overlays**: Use gradient overlays to blend with banner
3. **Glowing Elements**: Use cyan/blue glows for tech elements
4. **Abstract Representation**: Focus on abstract concepts, not literal depictions
5. **Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, modern, enterprise-grade look
6. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements should stand out with glow/color

## Usage Instructions

1. **For AI Image Generators** (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion):
   - Use the specific prompt for each solution
   - Add style modifiers: "professional illustration", "tech visualization", "modern design"
   - Specify: "dark theme", "cyan accents", "blends with dark background"

2. **For Design Tools** (Figma, Adobe Illustrator):
   - Use the color palette provided
   - Create abstract, geometric patterns
   - Add gradient overlays matching banner colors
   - Ensure dark theme compatibility

3. **Post-Processing**:
   - Add gradient overlays in CSS (already implemented in component)
   - Adjust brightness/contrast if needed
   - Ensure proper file optimization

## Notes

- All images should be designed to work with the existing gradient overlays in the component
- The component already adds gradient overlays, so images should be slightly brighter than final desired result
- Consider the text overlay on the left side when composing images
- Images should feel integrated into the banner, not floating above it
- Use transparency and gradients to create seamless blending
