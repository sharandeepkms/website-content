## Usage Tips

1. **For AI Image Generators**: Add "square format", "1:1 aspect ratio", "centered composition" to prompts
2. **Design Focus**: Square format allows for radial, circular, or symmetric compositions
3. **Visual Balance**: Ensure elements are distributed evenly for professional look
4. **Post-Processing**: The component already adds gradient overlays, so images should be slightly brighter
