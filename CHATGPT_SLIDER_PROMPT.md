## PROMPT FOR CHATGPT:

I need you to generate 4 premium technical illustrations for a website homepage slider. The images must blend seamlessly with a dark theme background and gradient overlays.

### CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENTS:

**Background Colors (MUST MATCH EXACTLY):**
- Base background: `#05060A` (very dark navy-blue-black)
- Gradient: `#050B18` → `#05060A` → `#02030A` (dark blue-black gradient)
- NO white, light gray, or bright backgrounds - images must have dark backgrounds matching these colors

**Theme Accent Colors:**
- Primary Blue: `#0041C2` (deep blue)
- Cyan: `#00C2FF` (bright cyan)
- Primary Light: `#4DBBFF` (bright cyan-blue)

**Gradient Overlays (will be applied on top):**
- Top-left radial glow: `rgba(64,116,255,0.15)` (soft blue)
- Bottom-right radial glow: `rgba(0,255,209,0.12)` (soft cyan)

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Resolution: 3000×1700 pixels (16:9 widescreen)
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Style: Premium, futuristic, enterprise-grade technical illustration
- NO TEXT, NO LOGOS - pure visuals only
- Images will be displayed on the right side of a split-screen layout

### IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:

**Image 1: slider-1.png - SONiC Datacenter Networking**
Create a dark-themed technical illustration showing:

**Image 4: slider-4.png - Secure & Observable Cloud Networking**
Create a dark-themed technical illustration showing:
- Segmentation rings and trust boundaries as layered circular blue (#0041C2) security zones
- Zero-trust architecture visualized as interconnected blue/cyan (#0041C2 to #00C2FF) protected zones
- Inline telemetry beams scanning through network nodes as soft cyan (#00C2FF) light rays
- Security signals as glowing shields and protective pulses in deep blue (#0041C2)
- Cloud-edge hybrid topology with secure connections in blue/cyan tones
- Observability patterns as cyan (#00C2FF) monitoring beams and data collection points
- SLO-driven assurance visualized as blue/cyan performance metrics and health indicators
- Security layers as translucent blue barriers with cyan accent glows
- Background must be dark (#05060A to #02030A) with subtle blue/cyan glows
- Secure, professional security operations visualization

### BLENDING REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Dark Background Integration**: Each image must have a base background color matching `#05060A` to `#02030A` - this ensures seamless blending with the slider background

2. **Gradient Overlay Compatibility**: Design elements should complement the radial gradient overlays that will be applied:
   - Top-left blue glow: `rgba(64,116,255,0.15)`
   - Bottom-right cyan glow: `rgba(0,255,209,0.12)`
   - Position glowing elements to align with these overlay positions

3. **Color Harmony**: Use blue (#0041C2) and cyan (#00C2FF) accents throughout - these colors will glow beautifully under the gradient overlays

4. **Depth and Layering**: 
   - Darker elements in the background
   - Brighter blue/cyan glows in the foreground
   - Subtle depth to create premium feel

5. **Seamless Edges**: Images should fade to the dark background color at edges, not have hard borders or white backgrounds

### GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Please generate all 4 images with these exact specifications. Each image should:
- Have a dark background (#05060A to #02030A)
- Include blue (#0041C2) and cyan (#00C2FF) glowing elements
- Be 3000×1700 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio
- Be saved as PNG format
- Have no text or logos
- Blend seamlessly with dark theme and gradient overlays

Generate these images one at a time, and I'll provide feedback if adjustments are needed.
